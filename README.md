# hand_written_digit_recognition
A Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer GUI using Neural Networks (no CNN) and tkinter-python

The goal is the predict or recognise a digit (0-9) if a picture of it is given. The dataset used to get pictures of hand written digits is MNIST.

A Deep neural network model has been trained on this dataset. Dense and Flatten layers in tensorflow are only used in order to avoid complexity. CNN can also be used to achieve more accuracy.

tkinter-python is used to create a GUI which enables us to draw a digit and get the prediction.
